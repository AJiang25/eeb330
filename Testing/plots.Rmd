```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
library(ggthemes)


ggplot(faithful) + 
    geom_point(aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting), 
    size = 5, 
    shape = "square",
    alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_abline(slope = -20, intercept = 125) + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting)) +
    theme_cowplot(20)
```


Modify the code below to make the points larger squares and slightly transparent.

Hint 1: transparency is controlled with alpha, and shape with shape
Hint 2: remember the difference between mapping and setting aesthetics
Add a line that separates the two point distributions. See ?geom_abline for how to draw straight lines from a slope and intercept.
