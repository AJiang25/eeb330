Description of files
-------------------------------------------------



(1) Data folder

This folder contains the datasets used in the paper.
 
 [1.1] 'Data_Fig1_StGrowth.csv' is the dataset for Fig1 representing the relative colony size of Acropora spp. coral recruits across the 24-month sampling period.

 [1.2] 'Data_Fig1_Innerplots' is the dataset of the inner plot of Fig1.

 [1.3] 'Data_Fig2a' is the dataset for Fig2a.

 [1.4] 'Data_Fig2b' is the dataset for Fig2b.

 [1.5] 'Data_model_Fig3' is the main dataset for the model depicted in Fig. 3. 
           Columns: n_recruit = density of recruits in the same quadrat; 
           growth_form = growth form of the colonies; 
           Initial_S = recruit size when first recorded in our sampling; 
           Exposure = exposure levels to wave energy; 
           G_cm2 = growth rates (expressed in cm² yr⁻¹) of individual coral colonies
           
 [1.6] 'Data_Fig4a.cvs' is the dataset for Fig24a.

 [1.7] 'Data_Fig4b' is the dataset for Fig24b, derived from Koester et al. (2021).
