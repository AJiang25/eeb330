# EEB330 - Open Science Exercise

## Assignment: Replicating a Figure from a Paper

## Background

In this assignment, you will replicate a figure from the paper one of the papers provided. You will use the data provided by the authors to replicate the figure using R or Python. You will then write a brief report describing your replication process and the results you obtained. 

## Instructions
1. Read the corresponding paper and identify a figure you would like to replicate.
2. Identify the figure you will replicate (Figure X).
3. Download the data provided by the authors 
4. Use R or Python to replicate the figure.
5. Write a brief report describing your replication process and the results you obtained.
6. Submit your report and the code used to replicate the figure.

### Notes

> Note that you do not need to _exactly_ replicate the figure; however, you should try to replicate the figure in form. Specifically, if you choose to use a different programming language or package from what the figure was originally generated in, you should make sure the form is there and not worry about exact replication.

## Grading
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

- Accuracy of the replicated figure.
- Clarity and completeness of the report.
- Quality of the code used to replicate the figure.
- (Bonus) Explain how the authors could have made the figure more aesthetically pleasing or more informative and implement this change.


## Paper Options

### Paper 1

[Natural recovery of corals after severe disturbance](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.14332)

Raw data and scripts can be found [here.](https://zenodo.org/records/8384830)

This paper provides scripts to replicate all the figures in the paper separately in the repository. Please refrain from looking at these. You can choose to replicate any figure you want.

### Paper 2

[Antagonistic regulation of salt and sugar chemotaxis plasticity by a single chemosensory neuron in Caenorhabditis elegans](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010637#sec019)

Raw data can be found [here.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010637.s003)
